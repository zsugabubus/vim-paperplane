## Features

- Shows parent indentations.

## Why?

[context.vim](https://github.com/wellle/context.vim) was on my “will try it if
need” list. However, when that day came… that was a sad day. Whole screen
flickered (why?) and it felt pretty slow. So I grabbed my keyboard and
reinvented it in 10th of the code.

It does not contains features like `show ellipsis (···) between the joined
parts if there was text between them in the original buffer`. WTF?! How the
hell can be no code between them.
