## Features

- Shows parent indentations.
- Uses preview window.
- Dumb (but still eats your CPU… search is expensive).

## Why?

[context.vim](https://github.com/wellle/context.vim) was on my “will try it if
need” list. However, when that day came… that was a sad day. Whole screen
flickered (why?) and it felt pretty slow. So I grabbed my keyboard and
reinvented it in 10th of the code to contain just the features I need.
