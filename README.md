## Features

- Neat.
- Dumb.
- Speedy.
- Uses preview window.

## Why?

[context.vim](https://github.com/wellle/context.vim) was on my “will try it if
need” list. However, when that day came… that was a sad day. Whole screen
flickered (why?) and it felt pretty slow. So I grabbed my keyboard and
reinvented it to contain just the features I need. It’s CPU friendly, speedy
and most importantly Works on My Machine™.
